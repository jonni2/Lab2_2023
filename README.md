# Laboratory of Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics 2
Material for data analysis for Lab2 course of 2023.

Experimental apparatus: <br />
 ------------	P3 <br />
 ------------	P2 <br />
%%%%%%%%%%%	Fe <br />
 ------------	P1 <br />

Things TO DO:
- USE and INVERT the PERFORMED Calibration to obtain the relation between clk ticks and ns in the csv DATA (do a PYTHON script)
- Analyze the background file R3\_background\_P123.csv and fit it with a pol0 to obtain the b parameter;
- Analyze the CLEANED data by fitting mainly P1 and P2 (because they're the closest to Fe).
