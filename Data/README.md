# Data folder
This folder contains data files to be analyzed and some utilities.

The script txtTocsv.sh is used to convert .txt files to .csv files, removing the first column of "\_" and converting the hexadecimal numbers to decimal numbers. Use it as it follows:
```console
bash txtTocsv.sh filename.txt
```
